# The Wall
A program to limit your mouse movement. 'cause why not?

# Why?
You may be asking yourself right now, "WHY!?! Why wouldn't I want 100% free control over my mouse?"

Ok, Ok. Think about this: right now you are probably subconsciously moving your mouse around this page,

there is nothing limiting you from putting wherever you want on your screen (Besides the edges).

But what if there was just a line in the middle of your screen. You can't go through it with your mouse, so you are forced to go around that line. This program is here just to remind you that: You have free will over where your mouse cursor goes.
